  Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. 
  Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; 
  our competence is from God, who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, 
  not of letter but of spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
  Now if the ministry of death, 
  chiseled in letters on stone tablets, 
  came in glory so that the people of Israel could not gaze at Moses' face 
  because of the glory of his face, a glory now set aside, 
  how much more will the ministry of the Spirit come in glory? 
  For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, 
  much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory! 
  Indeed, what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory; 
  for if what was set aside came through glory, much more has the permanent come in glory!

  Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness.''';
